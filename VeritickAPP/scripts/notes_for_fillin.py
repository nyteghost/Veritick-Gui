Hello,

Thank you for contacting SCA regarding your GCA equipment. Unfortunately, the address provided at the time that the ticket was placed does not match what we have been provided by GCA as your authorized shipping address.

To complete an address change, please submit the address  along with proof of residency to addresschanges@georgiacyber.org.  Proof of residency can include any of the following documents:
A current and complete Lease Agreement (showing signature date of lease, terms, name and address)
Most recent Mortgage Statement
Most recent Utility Bill showing the service address and issued within 60 days.
The proof of residency documentation must be issued in the Parent/Legal Guardianâ€™s name.  The date must be within the last 60 days.
 
Please note that a cell phone bill is not an acceptable Proof of Residency because it does not have a service address associated with the charge.

If you do not have a Proof of Residency document in your name, an Affidavit of Residence Form may be submitted, completed by you and the home owner/leasee. This form must be notarized.

If you do not have any of the above proof of residency documentation, please contact addresschanges@georgiacyber.org, 470-400-788 

Best,
